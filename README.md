Weathr is an application that a user can go to for all of their weather scheduling needs. The user will be able to login to their google account, and manage their favorite locations. It will also be easy to add new locations to your favorites. The user will also have a list of events that they have planned, these events will have an optional location and a weather description. Users will also be able to share the events they plan on going to on facebook.

Weathr will also be used for weather tourism. A user of the application will be able to type in exactly what climate he wishes to travel to, and the application will provide the nearest location that satisfies his desires. And of course add that location to his favorites.

Weathr will use The Dark Sky Forecast API for weather data [https://developer.forecast.io] and the Google Maps API [https://developers.google.com/maps/] for location data. The application will use Ruby on Rails, and will be deployed on the Google App Engine. [https://cloud.google.com/solutions/ruby/]
